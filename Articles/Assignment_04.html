<h> Day_04 <h/>
<h1> Summery <h1/>
<p> As a part of today's seesion we disscussed about problem solving and mark up language <p/>
<h2> problem solving <h2/>
<p> Based on today's session i got a breif idea about the few methods to solve the problem by logical methods like " euler's theorem " and " Hamilton theorem ".These two methods make me to understand  about the problem solving in logical methods.<p/>
<ol>
<li>
1. Euler's Theorem : Basically the euler's theorem is about a connected graph has an Euler cycle if and only if evrey vertix has even degree.The theorem helped me to understand the example givenin yesterday's "Konigsberg Bridge " puzzle.This a unsolved puzzle i find this puzzle in way thep process of giving every possible ways with out using any logical solution while i am solving thissolution it tooks me a long time to know that puzzle is unsolved .But when i compared with thoreyit just tooks me five minuets to solve. so based on this i got an idea about that when we are solving a problem we need to find all the possibilty ways to find a solution for problem.

2. Hamitons Theorem : Hamilto's theorem  we disscussed with an example of penta headral diagram.The Hamiltons theorem is basically about we need to connect the vertex and edges. but we can only draw the edge by not touching the vertex and we can go through edges multiple times.Based on this we solved a penta hedral diagram by solving with this theorem we find out that it is a unsolved puzzle.But it took us just 5 mins to solve the problem.based on this i understand that when ever we stuck with an issue we need to try with every possibilty ways to solve the problem and we can also solve our problem by using diffrent solutions.
<li/>
<ol/>
<p> Based on these two theorems i got and idea that when ever we solving a problem we can also write our constarnints in a logicall way and we can solve our problems by using these theoems.But not only these two theorems there are many theorems to help us to solve our problems by using thes kind of theorems.<p>
<h3> Mark up language <h3/>
<p> Mark up language is a system processing language. which will convert the symboles in to system understanding language and there are few methods to use in mark up langugge.<p/>
<ol>
<li>
They are:
<li> 1. XML <li/>
<li> 2. YAML <li/>
<li> 3. HTML <li/>
<ol/>
<li/>
<p>
There are few more languages these markup languagges will use to write down and make the system understand.HTMl is the extended languagge form XMl <p/>

<h3> Conclusion <h3/>
<p>
At last i wanna state that these are the topics problem solving , Mark up language  i learnd in  today's session.<p/>
