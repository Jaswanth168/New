# Introduction
      As a part of today's session i learnd about CLI and VIM
## Skills

   ### CLI and VIM

      # CLI
          Based on today's session i got a breif understanding on what is CLI
and how it works.I got an idea about how to create a folders and files in CLI
CLI is command line interface.
I understand the few key words about the CLI
Few Key words like
* ls - ls is the key word we used to check the list which we used to which are
 present in the directory.
* cd - cd is use to change the directory and used to acess the files in the directory

* cd .. - Is used to come out from the perticular diectory

* cp - cp is used to copy the perticular folder into the next folder
 
* cp -r - r stand for repostory and it will copy the perticular file from the repostory and it will paste slected folder that we choose to paste the folder

*sudo -sudo stands for "super user to do" it will help the user to get login in
to the root file to allow the user to acess the restricted files and it will
help the user to acess those files

* mkdir - mkdir is used to create files in the direcotry and it will allow the
to acess the files

* touch - touch is used to create a file in a folder 

* / - slash is used to combine the same sentence by giving slash 
ex: when we are creating a file name by Testing project by defualt it will take as testing as a seprate folder and project as a seprate folder by giving as 
mkdir Testig/ project

* cd ../ - Is use to go folder up 
  
These are the few key words which we used in cli(command line interface) to 
run the coomand and to create work space
 
      # VIM
          Based on session i got an idea about vim is text editor it has 
three methods to use
   1. command mode
   2. visual mode
   3. Insert mode
* command mode: command mode is use to run the commands and to save the fiels
 and to access the files and to save the files. 
Few keys to use in command mode
They are:

1. w - Is used to save the writtn file in insert mode
 
2. q _ is used to quit from the file

3. ^ - is used to take us to the Top of the sentence 

4. $ - it will take us to the end of the sentence

5. dd - It is used to delet the whole sentence which we selected

6. G - It will take us to the end of the line 

7. gg - If we tap on gg twice it will take us to the starting line of the 
sentence 
 


* visual mode: visual mode is used to see the text file. we can only copy and paste the texts but we  cant make any changes in visual mode. we can also select
the particular sentence and we can copy the particular sentence and we can paste sentence by using y we can copy and by p we can paste the perticular sentence
that we copied.

To open visual mode we need to tap on v it will take us to the visual mode.To 
exit from the visual mode we need to tap on esc

*Insert mode: To use insert mode we need to tap on * i * it will take us to 
insert mode and exit from the insert mode we need to tap in esc.

we can use insert mode to write texts and we can edit the whole text by using
insert mode

vi is a screen orianted text editor

* yum : yum (yellow dog updated modifier) is command helps to installing the packages user wanted usee in the system

* wget : wget is a command line utility tool used to download from the inernet 

## Basics of GIt: git is a software for tracking changes in any set of files,
useally used for coordinating work among programers collaboratively developing
source code during software dovelpoment.

There are few steps to follow to push the code to git hub

* step 1: We need to add the folder by usin "git init "

* step 2 : We need to add the folder by using "git add"

* step 3: we need to commit the folder and we store the file in rposetory by
 using "git commit"

* step 4: ww need to add orging to store in the local reposotry by using       "git reemote add orgin "url_name"

* step 5:we canpush the code by using " git push -u origin master"

These were the few methods which i understood to pus code into git hub.

### conclusion:

    At last i want to  mention that i have learnt and understood these topics
CLI,VIM and basics of GIt
