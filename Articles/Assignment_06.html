<h> Summery <h/>
<p> As a part of today's session i learnd about computer and number systems<p/>
<h2> Computer <h2/>
<p> I learnd about what is computer.Computer is a device which will computing the commands which
 is given by us and computing is mostly called as caliculations. I also understand the way how computer works.<p/>
<ol>
<li>
It depends on four ways 
They are :
<li> 1. input <li/>
<li> 2. Processor <li/>
<li> 3. Memory <li/>
<li> 4. Output <li/>

1. Input : Input is nothing but the commands which we give to the computer to make our work done they are few ways that we give input to the computer by using key board.

2. Processer : Processer is the next step which will be done after giving input to the system what ever the input we will give to the system it will process the input.

3. Memory : By processing the input the next step  is to store the proccessed input will be stored in the memory 

4. Output : By completing all the process of input,processing, and memory the final step is the output it will display the output based on the the input we give.
<ol/>
<li/>
<P>
I learnd about the process which will run behind the process of the above four types and there are few types of computers available like Mechanical,Electrical,Electronics,Quantam.I learnd about electrical computers this totally works on data .Data is a information that will store in the system memory and it will help us to do our work.
<p/>
<h2> Switch <h2/>
<p> Switch will help us to connects the two modules.i undersatand the way how switches will work is on and off the same way it will work in the system like bite .It will work as a collection of 8 bits = 1 byte s in that way there are 8 combinations of the numbers so this we will call as binary number system.<P/>
<h3> charcter set <h3/>
<p> A charcter set is a collection of charcters that might used by multiple languages,that can be used by Particular devices in a coding.I also learned about two types of charcter sets.<p/>
<ol>
<li>
They are :
<li> 1. ASCII <li/>
<li> 2. Unicode <li/>
<ol/>
<li/>
<ul>
<li> * ASCII : ASCII stands for Amarican standerd code for Information Interchange.It is a code for representing 128 english charcters as numbers,which each letter assigned as a number from 0 to 127.For example,the ascii code for uppercase m is 77.Most computers ude acii codes to represent text,which makes it possible to transfer data from one computer to another.

* Unicode : uncode just deal with numbers .They store letters and other charcters by assigninga number of each one .Before unicode was invented,there were hunderds of diffrent systems,called charcter encodings,for assiging these numbers.These early charcyer encoding were limited and could not contain enough charcters to cover all the words language.Even for single language like english no single encoding was adequer for all the letters,punctuations and technical symboles in commanuse.

Based on these to examples i got an idea about the system how it will take the input in the system understanding language and it will convert the input what we give to the system and make the system understand the input and converts our input as output.The whole system is working on charecter set which will make the system understand and give us the output.

 * Assembly : Assembly is nothing but the sub system which will store our ecah and individual part of our input and it will gather all the information and it will display as the one result.It isbuild on the top of OS transection layer which will gather the information and it will display togther as a ougtput.

<h4> Number Systems <h4/>
<p>
In Number systems we disscused about types of number system which are available and i also learned about Babylenion number theorem.
There are few types of number system like 
<ol>
<li> 1. uniary <li/>
<li> 2. Binary <li/>
<li> 3. Decimal <li/>
<ol/>
<ul>
<li>
* Babylenion Number system : Back in days the number system is not available so the people decide to give a perticular number to the time mothes and years.so the caliculation is based on hands in a hand with 4 fingers we can count 30 so by combain we can count 60 and the multiples oof 30's and 60's are totallay comabained as 365 day's in a a year and 30 day's in a month and in time alao they divided it and set a 60 mins as hour this makes me understand about the logic behined the numbers for time,months and years in a daily life.

* Example : Based on the example i understand two ways of problem solving and how to build a solution for a problem.When ever we are solving a problem by listing out all the constraints and the operations if we face a problem in th constraints we need to take it as a new problem and we need to find a solution for that problem after that we need to combain with the main problem it makes us solve our problem easily and when ever we are solving a problem and finding a solution this will help us to build the a added solution for the problem and it will help us to build a new method to solve a problem.
