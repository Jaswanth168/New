# Summery

* In today's session we discussed about the importence of the words and few more methods about problem solving methods

## Words:

* Based on  today session i got a breif idea about the words how important role in day-to-day life.There are few way that we express the words and what is the reason behind the words , why we use words  and based on the exampple of what are the  thoughts we get when hear a word it helps me in way that how to figure out the thuughts,i find few words to think through the process and imagin the reason behind the word and i got an idea on importance of words and how it will play a role.when ever  we work on someting we needs to know the terms of work. Based on totall disscusion igot a breif idea on how to use the words and what is the role it play in day-to-day life.

## Problem solving :

* From yesterday's session we continued the problem soloving topic.Based on today's session we started with how can we know the problem is solved. From this topics i got an idea that by covering all the constraints to solve the problem and the solution is formalized this will lead us to solvethe problem that we are facing.Solution formalised is nothing but as human being we can think about the possibility ways to solve the problem.But when we will soloving some problem by using system we need to make the system to follow our commands to solve the issue,so we need to thik in every possibility ways to guide the system to solve our problem. Basically solution formalized will help us to thik ina every possibilty way to solve the issue.

* While solving an example of puzzle about lock i expressed that i was over thinking about the small solution.Here i faild to follow the constraints which is help to solve the puzzile.After listing to the solution i felt like for small solution i over imagined about the problem and make it complicated.The lesson i learnt that from the example is  we need to find smart way and eassy ways to solve the solution by following the constraints and need to implete the steps what we decided to solve the issue.

* Based on the second puzzle that i understood  there were the problems which were unsolvable but.How i undeerstood the problem is unsolved is by applying all the constraints and the methods i decided to solve the problem and i coundn't break the problem by appling all those.But the first rule in problem solving is not to avoid the problem.so by follwing the rule i am trying to stick to the problem and find the diffrent ways to splve the problem .

## Problem Faced by software engineers:

* We divided the problems in to three types

- They are:

1. scalability problem 

2. Resource Constraint problems

3. Domain Problem

These are the topics we need to discuss in today's session

## Conclusion:
  At last i wanna state that i learnd these topics about words and problem solvnig
