# Introduction:

      As a part of first day session we classified skills in to few diffrent ways in that problem solving is of the skills that we discussed in today session and also a git commands to use push file to repository.

## Problem solving:

      one of the major understanding in today's session is when ever we face a problem first we need to understand the problem and we have to solve the problem by not evoiding the situation. We need to identify the constarints that will help us to sole the problem after we need to list all the possibilty operations the steps which we need to follow to solve the problem and arrange the operations 
  
     * constraints: Is nothing but chosse the possibility ways to solve the problem without avoiding the problem.

     * List all possibility Operations: we need to list all the possibility opertions to solve the problem it will help us to get an idea how to solve the problems

     * Arrange the opertaions to form a solution: By listing all the possibility operation in this, we will arrange the all possibility that we listed and we need to implement those step by step

These are the few steps that makes me to understand about problem solving.
 
## Tips:

There are few tips that i get when we were solving the examples that makes me3\ kj ][p  more understanding about on problem solving

* Those are:

1. Most constrains part: In this we need to concentrate on the constrains which  will lead us to solve our problem easily .Basically it will help us to solve
 our problem easily and fast.

2. Trail and Error: In this what ever the solutions we listed that we need to apply and check the reulst if it is error we need to go to other solution and try
on problem.

3. Break down the problem: when we are solving a problem we need to split the
 problem into diffrent ways that will help us to get an idea about the flow of  the problem that we are going to solve.

4. startgy: Startgy is the main key role to solve the problem we need to plan the above steps that  how to use in startgy. stratgy is nothing but deciding the apllied steps what we decide to do and we need to decide when to use those steps
Most of the problem solving methods i learnt in solving the examples which is   given in session by apllying those tips on the examples it gives me breif
 understanding on break down the problem.
 
* Examples:
       The examples that we practiced in the session it helps me to understand how to break down the problem in parts and slove the problem
 
* Ex: The squre root of concecutive numbers is a task t  finish as a team we     divided the square roots in parts and we added the all the possibility ways for each root and by comparing those result we started working on adding the       numbers and from decending order and we sstuck in between while solving the issue here we exprensied trial and error method.By using all these methods together i got a claer idea on how to slove the problem.

## Git:
  By today's session i got a brief idea on how to use commands to create a repository and how to add repository to the git and how to push the files to 
 repository

These are the few commands which i used while i am using git:

1. git int - It is a command which creats a new git repository.It can be used to convert an exisiting,unversiond project a git repository otr intilize a new empty repository

2. git remote add origin - It is used to store the added reposetory data it will be done by added by copying the link from the repository and it will link to the added repository.

These are few steps that we used to add  folder to the repository by using these
 commands.

There are few commands that we used to push the file to the repository by using these commands.
* They are:

1. git add - By using "git add file name"it will add the particular file to the rpoisitory

2. git commit - By using "git commit -m "commit name"" it will give the commit name to the file that we are adding to the git hub

3. git pull origin - By using "git pull origin main"it will pull the file from the directory to main origin

4. git push origin - By using "git push origin HEAD:main"it will push the file to master brach to the git hub

These are the commands we used to push the file from directory to repoistory in git hub.
 
## conclusion:
     At last i wanna state that i learnd these topics Problem solving and git hub commands to push the file to repository.
