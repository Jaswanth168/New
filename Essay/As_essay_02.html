<h> A Tereible accident <h/>
<p> It was a lazy weekend as usual with nothing much to do.There was nothing worth watching on televison either.All the goo9d programers are usually aired during the week when loads of homework and household chres keep me busy.Mom was busy in the kitchen preparinhg luch ans dad had gone to vista sick friend.

I decided to go fo a walk to New Road.The sun shone brightly overheaddd but there was a noticeaible chill in the air.November is a favourite month for me. I had just reached Lainchour when I noticed a huge crowd near the campus. There seemed to be chaos everywhere.more and more people were adding t the crowd.Policemen were also seen shouting instructions in to their walkie-talkies.

I managed to get into the crows. It was the most horrible sighy that I had ever witnessed in mu life.A car had been destroyed completely and it was lying just outside the capus gate . A moter bike lay to one side damaged and covered with the blood. The rider of the bike was badly injured but he servived. He was rushed away to a nesrby hospital in an ambulance.

It was then that i saw the bodies. A young woman in her twenties lay dead on the road. she must have been beautiful once with her long blonde hair.Her car hit the campus wall while she was  trying to avoid an accident with a fast bike.That moment oct her.She crashed into the solid campus walls and in a flash of a second,her life was extinguished like a flam.

I watched as people helped the police to lift her body.I got a further shock when i saw a little babby boy beneath her body.He was her son.The people picked him up too.His face and right side of hid body was awew injured badly.I turned away in horrer and ran from the scene.

What started off as pleasant stroll on a lovely saturday morning,turned out to be a terrible experience.I stiil remember the scene clearly.I guess it will take me a long time to forget the sight of mother and child lying in. <p/>
