# Weekly Report

##  Day_1:
    
      The starting day of our intership we started learning about the skills need to be software enginner.
They are :
1. Reading 
2. writing 
3. Mathamatical Thinking 
4. Problem solving
5. Researching 
6. Breaking Down
7. Typing 
8. Creativity
   I got a basic understand on each and every skill that are listed and got an idea about the internship.i also got an idea on five diffrent types of skills it is introduced by Derfus.The five types diffrentitae skills are :
1. Novie
2. Advanced Beginer 
3. Competent
4. Prosicient 
5. Expert
    These are the five steps which will help us to know the stage we are and i learnd that by end of this internship i need to be in Advanced beginer stage.To get the advanced begineer i need to practice those skills needs to be software engineer.

    I also learnd how to install virtual box and i learnt the basic commands which generally used as a commands in terminal and i also learnt about the git hub commands and i created a repository in git by using git command's

##  Day_2 :

      In day_2 we started with one of the skill is problem solving.
### Problem solving:
         In problem solving i started learning from how to split the problem and solve the problems.There are few methods to follow when we are solving a problem.
They are :
1. Understanding the problem
2. Identify the constraints 
3. list all the possibility
4. Arrange the operations to form a solution

By using all these methods we can solve the problem and i got an clear idea on how to list down the constraints and the possibility ways to solve the problem.solving puzzels which is given in seession helps me to get a clear idea on problem solving.

As a practice of one more skill is Typing for that we are assigned to write a 1000 words essay as a daily articel.By doing that assignmet i got a practice on typing and by pushing these articles to the git it helps to understand the way how git works.

## Day_3:

       In day_3 we started with words and few more tips about problem solving
### Words :
     In session about words i got an idea about what is the reason every word.By the example of giving a word and writing down the first word what we get is really helped me the way of i am thinkng and i got an idea how i really thinks and i got an idea about the words.
### Problem solving:
     In problem sloving i got a cleary idea about the way of thinking and listing down the constraints and there are few tips which help's me to process through the problems solve the problems and the tips to solve the problem .
They are :
1. Most constrains part
2. Trail and error
3. Break dowm the problem 
4. Startagy
5. Look for analogies
By apllying all these tips on problem we can solve our problem.By the example of Konigsberg i got a clear idea how to use these tips on the example and the puzzle is unsolveble.
## Day_4:

      In Day_4 we discussed about the few theorem for problem solving and mark up language.

## Problem solving theorem:

    When ever we have problem which is unsolvable to know that the problem is unsolvable We can use theorem and we can know that problem is unsolvable and it help us to think in a logicall way of thinking to solve a problem .so as example we had two theorems that we used in session one is Euler's Theorem and Hamilton theorem these two theorem help's me to get an idea about how to solve the problem in logical way of thinking and solving the problem.

## Mark up language : 

    markup language is a system for annoating a document in a way that is visually distiguishble from the content.
There are few mark up languages
They are :
1. XMl
2. YAML
3. HTML
These are the languages wich we use as a  mark up languages and markup language will help to forma basic structer to the formate that we are giving as input.
