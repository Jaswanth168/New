<h> Summary <h>
<p> Toady as a part of internship we started with solving the puzzles which is given as a assignment for the day.<p/>
<ul>
<li>
- There are three puzzles to solve.
- They are:
<li> * Harry potter puzzle <li/>
<li> * Table Puzzle <li/>
<li> * The shortest way to reach the Jerry <li/>

* Harry potter : While solving this solution,i got an idea how to follow the constraints and the operations which we will decide to solve the problem.by soloving this problem i noted all the constraints and operations which i followed and solve the problem and i felt easy to solve the problem by follwing the process

* Table Puzzle : The problem is about finding the possibility ways to find the best solution for the problem.The process which i followed is i arranged the each colum as per constraints and i aranged in the formate of ascending and decending order and i found the series which is matching to the original tabel and finding the number of advantages and disadvantages of the series and i choose the solution for the proble.Based on this problem i got an idea about how to brak down the problem and solve the problem and combain the problem.

* Tomy and Jerry Puzzle : while solving this puzzle i followed the way of trail and error method checking the every possibility way of the solution and if one method is faild trying with the new method which will match with constraints and helps to get the solution.I followed all the constarints and operations,trying diffrent methods to solve the problem.

<h2> Conslusion <h2/>
<p> At last i wanna say that based on yesterday's seession i tried all the tips and i followed all the tips to solve the puzzle.<p/>
